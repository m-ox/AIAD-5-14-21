# Sticky Note App

The classic. Originally mine and Leo's first (and well... eventually only) app in a day with Bottega University. Ambitious attempt considering we just were introduced to React in that first week. It's currently using Bottega's portfolio backend, even though that is very much not the purpose, but hey, it works.
